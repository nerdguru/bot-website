- The current site is a single page with very wordy and busy sections that have
relative links from the nav bar

- More modern web design focuses on minimalism, making it easier for people to
do what they want to do on a particular site or pages

- For BOT, people primarily come to the site for two tasks:
  - Buy Tickets
  - Learn about auditions

- The design goals I started with:
  - Multiple pages
  - Remove everything that can be removed without losing function
  - Adaptive to different screen widths
  - Buy tickets button above the fold

- Original home page
  - Too much space above the fold, not enough content
  - Lack of favicon (minor)
  - Not clear if web hoster is prohibiting custom pages,
    but assume they don't for now or we'd move hosters

- Proposed home page
  - Shorter top nav that moves both logo and social to navbar
  - Splashy graphic for current show, purchase button above fold for most widths
  - Box office restrictions below fold on home page instead of on different page
  - Adaptive to width, clickable phone number on mobile
